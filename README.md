ST2-plugin-Insert-File-Here
===========================

This is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 (OSX Mountain Lion) that inserts the contents of a file / template (e.g., *.txt, *.tex, etc.) at the current caret position.

It is an unofficial modification of https://github.com/mneuhaus/SublimeFileTemplates

Having been word processing for the past quarter century, I missed the "insert file here" feature in ST2.  I did not want to convert my entire form file directory into snippets or xml files (incorporating or referencing the path to my own forms).

With this plugin, my form files can remain anywhere I choose and modified directly wtihout the need to fiddle with snippets.  I do use snippets, but I also enjoy simply inserting a non-snippet file at the caret position.
